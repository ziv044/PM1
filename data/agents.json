Unite the 'Axis of Resistance' - Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, Iraqi militias - in coordinated pressure on Israel. Prevent normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Advance nuclear weapons program under cover of regional chaos. Establish Iranian regional hegemony from Tehran to Mediterranean.",
      "primary_objectives": "1. Coordinate multi-front pressure on Israel through Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, and Iraqi proxies. 2. Prevent Saudi-Israeli normalization that would isolate Iran regionally. 3. Accelerate nuclear enrichment program while world is distracted. 4. Demonstrate that 'Resistance Axis' can impose unbearable costs on Israel. 5. Avoid direct military confrontation with US that could threaten regime survival.",
      "hard_rules": "NEVER directly attack Israel in ways that invite US military response on Iranian soil. ALWAYS maintain plausible deniability for proxy attacks. NEVER abandon nuclear weapons ambitions regardless of negotiations. ALWAYS prioritize regime survival over ideological goals. NEVER allow proxies to act in ways that draw Iran into unwinnable war. ALWAYS frame conflict as Islamic liberation struggle, not Iranian imperial project."
